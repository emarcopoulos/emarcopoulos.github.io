    <p> yYou're probably here wodering about me! :o</p>
    <p>I grew up in a small town in New Jersey
      called Park Ridge. I went to West Ridge Elementary School and then
      later on Park Ridge High School. During my time at PRHS, I was
      a member of many groups: I was an actor in the theatre programs, a
      long distance runner for the track teams, a clarinet player and drum
      major for the marching band, a basketball player, an origami teacher
      for elementary enrichment, the president of the local GOYA, and an
      altar person for St. Athanasios Greek Orthodox Church. </p>
    <p> Graduating from high school in 2015, I then enrolled at Tufts
      University. There, I spent time working as a dishwasher and as a TA
      for Intro to Computer Science (and later more advanced courses!). 
      I played the clarinet and became president of the pep
      band. I often enjoyed coding games just for fun. I graduated from the
      School of Engineering in 2019 with degrees in Computer Science,
      English and Physics.</p>
    <p>I did four internships while at Tufts and have since graduating worked two jobs full time!</p>
    <p>If you are reading this, well, say hello to me! :)</p>
